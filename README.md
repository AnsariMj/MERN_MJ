A Book CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in the MERN stack involves building a web application it allows users to manage books. The MERN stack comprises MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the web application framework, React.js for building the user interface, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

The database stores information about books. Each book entry typically has attributes such as title, author, genre, publication date, etc.
MongoDB is a NoSQL database, and its flexibility allows for easy storage and retrieval of data in JSON-like BSON format.

Express.js is used to create a server that handles HTTP requests and responses.

React.js is used to build the user interface (UI) of the application.

Node.js serves as the runtime environment for the server-side application.
